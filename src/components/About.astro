      Rumah was born from a problem we knew too well. You’ve got the money.
      You’re ready to rent. But somehow… you’re stuck. There are barely any
      houses to see, and even fewer agents who care. The ones you do find?
      Suddenly they’re special. They know they’re your only shot — even if they
      have nothing within your budget. So, you wait. You follow up. You hope.
    </p>
  
    <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl text-start mx-auto mt-4">
      That feeling? We hated it. So we built Rumah — a platform where no one
      gets stuck. Where you can actually see what’s out there through quality
      pictures. Where agents don’t hold all the power. Where your budget doesn’t
      make you invisible.
    </p>
  
    <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl text-start mx-auto mt-4">
      We believe house-hunting should feel like freedom, not frustration. It
      should be about finding your next space, not chasing shadows. Rumah gives
      you options. Gives you visibility. Gives you back control.
    </p>
  
    <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl text-start mx-auto mt-4">
      We created this platform because we know what it’s like to feel stuck with
      no choices — and we know how powerful it feels when you finally have
      some!

    <p class="text-[20px] text-[#A3A3A3] max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      Rumah was founded in 2025 with a simple mission — to make house hunting easier, more transparent, and way less frustrating for everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="text-[20px] text-[#A3A3A3] max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
      We started with a personal problem: having the money to rent, but no clear options to choose from. Few listings. Fewer agents. And even less control. So we built something better — a platform where people can explore real homes within their budget, see exactly what they’re getting, and connect directly with agents who actually care.
    </p>
    <p class="text-[20px] text-[#A3A3A3] max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
      We focus on clarity, trust, and access, not confusion, gatekeeping, or endless waiting. We believe in a housing experience that puts power back in the hands of regular people — where finding a home feels exciting, not exhausting.
    </p>
    <p class="text-[20px] text-[#A3A3A3] max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
      Our goal? To help people move better, live better, and feel more in control of their journey — whether it’s their first apartment or their next big step.
    </p>
    <p class="text-[20px] text-[#A3A3A3]  max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
      Millions of people face the same problem we did. But we’re not stopping at just solving it — we’re reimagining it. The vision is big: a world where everyone has the tools, the options, and the confidence to find a space that truly fits.
    </p>
    <p class="text-[20px] text-[#A3A3A3] max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
      And we’re just getting started.
